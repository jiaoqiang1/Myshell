To enable these modules and servers, uncomment the lines so the file now contains:

/etc/rsyslog.conf
# provides UDP syslog reception
$ModLoad imudp
$UDPServerRun 514

# provides TCP syslog reception
$ModLoad imtcp
$InputTCPServerRun 514
Save and close the rsyslog configuration file.

Restart rsyslog by running:

sudo service rsyslog restart
Your centralized rsyslog server is now configured to listen for messages from remote syslog (including rsyslog) instances.

Tip: To validate your rsyslog configuration file, you can run the sudo rsyslogd -N1 command.

Step 4 â€” Configuring rsyslog to Send Data Remotely
In this section, we will configure the rsyslog-client to send log data to the ryslog-server Droplet we configured in the last step.

In a default rsyslog setup on Ubuntu, you'll find two files in /etc/rsyslog.d:

20-ufw.conf
50-default.conf
On the rsyslog-client, edit the default configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf
Add the following line at the top of the file before the log by facility section, replacing private_ip_of_ryslog_server with the private IP of your centralized server:

/etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf
*.*                         @private_ip_of_ryslog_server:514
